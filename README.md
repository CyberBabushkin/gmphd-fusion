# GM-PHD with fusion

This is the code written of the GM-PHD filter with support for external information fusion. This implementation is the part of my Master's thesis. The module is written in Python 3.10. The experiments were held using the Jupyter notebook.

## Install

Simply run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mannannlegur/gmphd-fusion.git gmphd-fusion
pip install -e gmphd-fusion
```

Then you can use the package in your environment.

## Using the package

Examples of usage can be found in [notebooks](./notebooks), especially [`runners.py`](./notebooks/runners.py) with several handy functions and the [experiment notebook](./notebooks/gmphd.ipynb), where these functions are used.
